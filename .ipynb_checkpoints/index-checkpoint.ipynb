    "The evaluation metrics indicate that our linear regression model performs exceptionally well in predicting stock prices based on the features provided.\n",
    "* 1. Mean Absolute Error (MAE): The average absolute difference between the predicted stock prices and the actual stock prices is approximately 1.469. This means, on average, our model's predictions are off by around 1.469 units from the actual prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "* 2. Mean Squared Error (MSE): The average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual stock prices is approximately 4.534. MSE penalizes larger errors more than MAE due to the squaring operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* 3. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): The square root of the MSE is approximately 2.129. RMSE is in the same unit as the target variable (stock price), and it provides a more interpretable measure of the average prediction error.\n",
    "\n",
    "* 4. R-squared (R2) Score: The R-squared score, which is approximately 0.999, indicates that our model explains about 99.9% of the variability in the stock prices.
